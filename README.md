# subway-map-generation

## What is this that I've stumbled upon?

Going to PyCon AU 2019 inspired me to start playing around with procedural generation of stuff. For art. Specifically, [this one repository](https://github.com/nathan-hellinga/subway-map-generator) that does random generation of subway maps in Processing.py got me thinking about subway maps.

So this is a series of experiments in subway map generation.

## How do I run this thing?

Install dependencies through yarn

```
$ yarn install
```

Then either run:

```
$ yarn run dev
```

for the main project. Or, if you want to test out the animations stuff that I was showing on Twitter, run:

```
$ yarn run dev:testing-animations
```

Contributions welcome!
